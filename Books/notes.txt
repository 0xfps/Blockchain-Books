Tests are deployed to `0xb4c79daB8f259C7Aee6E5b2Aa729821864227e84`. If you deploy a contract within your test, then `0xb4c...7e84` will be its deployer. If the contract deployed within a test gives special permissions to its deployer, such as Ownable.sol's onlyOwner modifier, then the test contract `0xb4c...7e84` will have those permissions.
